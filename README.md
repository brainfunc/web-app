# Brainfunc Game Web Application
BrainFunc is an e-learning adventure where you can apply your knowledge of neuroscience to compete and win in battles. 


We're building a game where you can collect neurons (crypto collectibles in the game), use them to construct your own unique brain parts and use them to fight epic battles! All this while learning about different brain parts and their functions. We know it sounds super intriguing and fun, and we can't wait for you to get started.


This repository is the core web app for BrainFunc. Currently under active development and being built on the Ethereum blockchain making use of ERC 721 protocol for non fungible assets.
